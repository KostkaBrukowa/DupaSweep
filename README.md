A 5x3 split keyboard with 3 thumbs. There is nothing unique about the keyboard layout. It's practically choc mini Sweep keyboard with
extra key and no TRRS. I've removed TRRS to support diode-less build for wireless option.

Top outlines matches Exactly the original sweep outlines, bottom outlines are adjusted to the extra key.

Gerber files are available for the left and right halves. You can find them in the GitHub actions panel.

See the [workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) or the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details.
